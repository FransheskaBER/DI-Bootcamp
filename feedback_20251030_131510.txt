suggestions for improvement:
- Install all the required libraries
- The `rss-parser` import statement should use `require` instead of `import`, aligning with the instructions.
- Verify that the view engine setup correctly uses `path.join(__dirname, 'public')` to resolve the path to the 'public' directory where views are stored.
- Ensure the correct file path is specified when rendering pages, e.g., `res.render('pages/index')` and that this path is relative to the `views` directory
