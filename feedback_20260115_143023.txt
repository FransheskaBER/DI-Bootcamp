suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding more detailed error handling and logging for debugging purposes.
- Implement rate limiting to protect against brute-force attacks, especially on the /auth routes.
- Ensure proper input validation and sanitization to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
- Use environment variables for sensitive information like the CORS origin instead of hardcoding it.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding more robust error logging, potentially including specific error types from jwt.verify.
- For enhanced security, explore options for preventing token replay attacks.

suggestions for improvement:
- This code snippet sets up a PostgreSQL database connection pool, which is not directly related to the JWT authentication guide.  While database interaction is eventually required (Exercise: 'Replace in-memory user data with a persistent database storage solution'), the core focus of the guide is on JWT implementation.
- Consider using environment variables for sensitive information like database URLs instead of hardcoding them.
- Ensure proper error handling throughout the application to prevent exposing sensitive information.
- While disabling `rejectUnauthorized` might be necessary for certain cloud database providers like Neon, it's generally recommended to configure SSL properly for enhanced security in production environments.
