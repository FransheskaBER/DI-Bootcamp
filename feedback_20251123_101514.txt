suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding more descriptive class names or comments to enhance readability further.
- For better performance, especially with larger text inputs in the `TextCounter` component, you might explore debouncing the input change handler.

suggestions for improvement:
- This code snippet defines a ThemeProvider and ThemeContext, which is a good start, but it doesn't implement the full exercises as described. There are two exercises, not just one.
- Exercise 1 requires creating a theme switcher component that uses the context. This code provides the context but not the component.
- Exercise 2 requires the use of useRef to implement a character counter. This code does not implement that functionality.
- Exercise 3 requires the use of useReducer to manage todo items, which is not implemented here.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding more descriptive comments to explain the purpose of the component and its functionality.
- The inline styling is acceptable for a small component, but for larger applications, consider using CSS classes for better maintainability.
