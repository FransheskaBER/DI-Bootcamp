suggestions for improvement:
- Consider creating a separate function to handle the re-rendering logic (render and renderFavs) to avoid duplication in the removeRecipe and toggleFavorite callbacks.
- The code could benefit from better error handling, especially when dealing with localStorage.
- Consider using a more robust state management solution if the application grows in complexity.
