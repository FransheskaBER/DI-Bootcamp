URL: URL: https://github.com/FransheskaBER/DI-Bootcamp/blob/main/Week_18/Day6/ExerciseXP/my-app/src/AddTodo.jsx
suggestions for improvement:
- The code only implements the 'add todo' functionality. It's missing the implementation for toggling a todo's completion status and removing a todo, as requested in the instructions. Consider adding those functionalities to fulfill all requirements.
- Add corresponding reducers and actions for completing and removing the todos.
- Consider error handling, for example, if dispatch fails.
- Although the code works, the `id` generation might not be the best approach. Using a dedicated library for generating unique IDs (like UUID) can be more reliable.

suggestions for improvement:
- Provide the reducer, actions, store configuration, and the React component that displays the todo list to assess the correctness of the entire application.
- Consider adding prop types for better code maintainability and clarity.

suggestions for improvement:
- The component should receive a boolean value for the completed prop, and the checkbox should reflect this boolean state directly.
- Instead of using `e.target.value`, `e.target.checked` should be used to get the boolean value of the checkbox.
- The local state `taskComplete` isn't needed as you already have `completed` as a prop.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider moving the conditional rendering logic (todos.length > 0 ? ... : ...) into a separate function or component for better readability.
- Ensure that the `CompleteTodo` and `RemoveTodo` components correctly dispatch actions to update the Redux store based on user interactions.
- Add PropTypes to the component to explicitly define the expected data types for the props, which enhances code maintainability and reduces potential errors.
- Sanitize the `task.title` when rendering it to prevent potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, especially if the titles are user-generated.
- Use memoization techniques (e.g., React.memo) to prevent unnecessary re-renders of the component if the `todos` prop hasn't changed.

URL: URL: https://github.com/FransheskaBER/DI-Bootcamp/blob/main/Week_18/Day6/ExerciseXP/my-app/src/App.jsx
suggestions for improvement:
- The code is incomplete. While it sets up the basic structure of a React-Redux application for a todo list, it doesn't include the actual Redux logic (actions, reducers) or the detailed implementation of the `AddTodo` and `DisplayTodos` components as described in the instructions.
- It lacks the specific implementation of Redux actions, reducers, and the connection of React components to the Redux store. Without these elements, the application cannot manage the todo list state effectively.
- The instructions also mentioned testing the application and applying CSS styling, which is not present in the code.

URL: URL: https://github.com/FransheskaBER/DI-Bootcamp/blob/main/Week_18/Day6/ExerciseXP/my-app/src/store/todoStore.js
suggestions for improvement:
- The code only shows the creation of the Redux store using Redux Toolkit, and imports a `todoReducer`. It doesn't define the actions, action creators, or the structure of the `todoReducer` itself.  The task requires defining actions for adding, toggling, and removing todos. It also needs to implement the reducer logic for these actions.
- While Redux Toolkit simplifies Redux development, the core concepts of actions and reducers still need to be explicitly defined to fully address the exercise.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider standardizing on either mutating or immutable updates. While Immer allows mutation, explicitly immutable updates are often easier to reason about and debug in complex applications.
- Add type definitions to the parameters of the reducer functions
