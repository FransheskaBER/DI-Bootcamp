Databases:

- A database is a data structure that stores organize info
- most databases contain multiple tables
- it is a systematic collection of data and makes data managment easy
- it can be RELATIONAL and NON-RELATIONAL

WHAT IS PostgreSQL?
- It is an open source OBJECT-RELATIONAL database system (that uses the language SQL)
- In other words, it is a database management sytem similar to RELATIONAL database but with an object-oriented database model (objects, classes, inheritance).

TYPES OF DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (DBMS):
1. Relational (save data in table formats - predefined database)
2. Non-relational
3. Hierarchical (tree structures with notes)
4. Networks (servers)
5. object oriented relation (storage of new data types in form of objects)


RELATIONAL DATABASE:
- A type of database that uses a specific structure that allows us to identify and access data IN RELATION to another piece of data.
- You can access, update, and search stored info/data in different tables
- They are used in complicated queries like analysis data, database transactions, etc.

What is a Relational Database Managment System:
- Allows to create, update, and manage relational database, mainly using sql language.

What is SQL language?
- Structure Query Language > it is a programming language used to communicate with store info from a relational database managment system.

Examples of RELATIONAL DATABASES (they represent and store data in tables and rows):
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- SQLite3

NON-RELATIONAL DATABASE:
- Refer as NoSQL databases
- Handle LARGE amounts of data with no or little structure
- Examples of NON-RELATIONAL DB: MongoDB (Represent data in collections of json docs)
- They scale out - they are easy to scale
-
