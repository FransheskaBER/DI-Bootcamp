    // Variables
    // Conditionnals
    // Loops


    // Exercise 1 : Checking the BMI
    // Instructions
    // Hint: You must use functions to complete this exercise, to do so take a look at tomorrow’s lesson.

    // Create two objects, each object should hold a person’s details. Here are the details:
    // FullName
    // Mass
    // Height

    // Each object should also have a key which value is a function (ie. A method), that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of each person
    // Outside of the objects, create a JS function that compares the BMI of both objects.
    // Display the name of the person who has the largest BMI.

    const person1 = {
        FullName: "Louise Vasquez",
        BMI: function(){
            return this.Weight / (this.Height ** 2);          
        },
        Weight: 70,
        Height: 1.70
    };

    const person2 = {
        FullName: "Mary Rodriguez",
        BMI: function(){
            return this.Weight / (this.Height ** 2);      
        },
        Weight: 60,
        Height: 1.85
    };

    function largestBMI(){
        if (person1.BMI() > person2.BMI()){
            console.log(`${person1.FullName} has the largest BMI: ${Math.round(person1.BMI())}`)
        } else {
            console.log(`${person2.FullName} has the largest BMI: ${Math.round(person2.BMI())}`)
        };
    };

    largestBMI();




    // Exercise 2 : Grade Average
    // Instructions
    // Hint: This Exercise is trickier then the others. You have to think about its structure before you start coding.
    // You must use functions to complete this exercise, to do so take a look at tomorrow’s lesson.

    // In this exercise we will be creating a function which takes an array of grades as an argument and will console.log the average.

    // Create a function called findAvg(gradesList) that takes an argument called gradesList.

    // Your function must calculate and console.log the average.

    // If the average is above 65 let the user know they passed

    // If the average is below 65 let the user know they failed and must repeat the course.
    // Bonus Try and split parts 1,2 and 3,4 of this exercise to two separate functions.
    // Hint One function must call the other.

    function findAvg(gradesList){
        let sum = 0
        for (let i=0; i < gradesList.length; i++){
            sum += gradesList[i];
        };
        const average = sum / gradesList.length;
        return average;
    };

    function passed(grades){
        const average = findAvg(grades);
        if (average > 65){
            console.log(`You passed the course with an average grade of ${average}`);
        } else {
            console.log(`You failed the course with an average grade of ${average}`);
        };
    };

    passed([90, 95, 100, 85]);
