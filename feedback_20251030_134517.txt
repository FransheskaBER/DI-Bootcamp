suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding some logging or error handling for unexpected issues during the RSS feed parsing to improve debugging.
- Implement input sanitization to prevent potential injection attacks, especially in the search routes.
- Add caching to the RSS feed data to reduce the number of requests to the external feed.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding error handling or validation for user inputs to prevent potential issues.
- Implement input sanitization to prevent XSS vulnerabilities, especially when displaying post content.

suggestions for improvement:
- The server.js file is commented out. Make sure to uncomment it to run the application. 
- The server.js code uses modern JavaScript syntax (import/export) which is good, but requires proper setup (e.g., Babel or ES modules in Node.js).  It should be transpiled or configured to run in Node.js.
- Consider using environment variables for sensitive information like the port number.
- Implement error handling to gracefully manage potential issues such as network errors or invalid RSS feed data.
- The HTML structure in search.ejs is functional but could benefit from improved semantics and accessibility. Ensure form elements have labels associated with them.
- Validate and sanitize user inputs (title and category) in the server-side code to prevent potential security vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) or injection attacks.
