DEFINITIONS
---------------------
1. HTML DOM (document object model):
- it is a map of your webpage that browsers create so JS can read and change the page. 
- HTML DOM is an structured tree. Each HTML element becomes a "node" in the tree.
- The browsers give you a special OBJECT called document in JS.
- So, you can use JS to find elements, change content/styles and add/remove elements.
- the DOM connect static HTML with dynamic JS
- So DOM represents the doc as nodes and objects (in other words DOM is the object-oriented representation of the webpage whcih can be modified with scripted language like JS)
- Modern DOM is built using multiple APIs that work together. Also, other APIs can add new features/capabilities to the DOM.
