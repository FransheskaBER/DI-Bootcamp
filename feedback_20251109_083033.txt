suggestions for improvement:
- The code provided is a CSS snippet and is completely unrelated to the React/JSX exercises presented in the chapter content. The exercises involve creating React components, using JSX, passing props, and applying styles using inline styles and CSS files, not just presenting a CSS snippet in isolation.
- Consider including code snippets demonstrating the React components and JSX elements created as requested, demonstrating how styles are applied to the React elements.
