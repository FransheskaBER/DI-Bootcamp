Connect databases to python to write queries from the python file

Use a code library for relational database like:

- psycopg2 for PostgreSQL
- MySQLdb for MySQL
- cx_Oracle for Oracle
- SQLite (built into python 2.7 - import sqlite3)


Python's built-in module sqlite3 works with SQL databases.

Everytime you execute a query you need to open the connection, then the query, then commit and then close. 

- Open connection:

conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database_name.sqlite')
cur = conn.cursor()

- Perform your query:

cur.execute("""
YOUR SQL QUERY
""")

- Commit changes and close (if you use these commands, you will need to open the connection
again to do another query):

conn.commit() #the commit save your changes
conn.close()


However, you don't need to close the connection but the cursor/query and then perform another query:

cursor.close()
