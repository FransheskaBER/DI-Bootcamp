FOR-LOPP
------------------------
- like a loop, it executes a block of codes a number of times.
- each execution of the code is called iteration
- instead of writing the same line 10 times, you tell the loop "do this action 10 times"



SYNTAX
----------------------
for (start; condition; update) {
  // code to run
}


ARGUMENTS
-----------------------
start → create a counter (e.g., let i = 0).

condition → decide when to stop (e.g., i < 5).

update → how the counter changes each time (e.g., i++ means add 1).



EXAMPLES
-------------------------
for (var temp = 0; temp < 5; temp++) {
  // Runs 5 times, with values of temp 0 through 4.
  console.log(temp + ": Institute!");
}



const basket = ["apple", "oranges", "grapes"];

for (let i=0; i<basket.lenght; i++) {
  console.log(basket[i]);
}

basket.forEach(item => {
  console.log(item);
})


- for of > iterating, go one by one through the aaray basket and look at each item in the basket,
you can iterate over arrays and strings. iterate is only for arrays and strings.

for (item of basket) {
  console.log(item);
}

- for in > work only for objects properties, we are no iterating, we are enumerating over each property
so we can see the properties. enumerate is only for objects
const detailedBaskets = {
  apples: 5, 
  oranges: 10, 
  grapes: 1000
}

for (item in detailedBaskets) {
  console.log(item)
}
