MAIN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TRUNCATE AND DELETE

- both are to delete the table's data

- When deleting a table's data, TRUNCATE resets its identity whereas DELETE doesn't

- Syntax:
		TRUNCATE TABLE table_name
			vs
		DELETE FROM table_name

- TRUNCATE is definition whereas DELETE is manipulation

- DELETE is slower than TRUNCATE
