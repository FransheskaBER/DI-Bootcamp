1. UPDATE statement (to change values in a table):

UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1,
    column2 = value2
WHERE
   condition;

- to change values of the whole table then remove the WHERE condition.

- if you want that it will return the updated table use:

RETURNING
   column1,
   column2;


EXAMPLES:

- Change the birthdate of ‘Matt Damon’

UPDATE actors SET age='1970-01-01' WHERE first_name='Matt' AND last_name='Damon';


2. DELETE (delete data from a table):

DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;

- to delete all rows, remove WHERE condition

DELETE FROM table_name;

- you can also return the delete record with RETURNING
DELETE FROM actors WHERE actor_id=4
RETURNING actor_id, first_name, last_name, number_oscars;


3. TRUNCATE (to delete all data all rows from the table):

TRUNCATE TABLE table_name RESTART IDENTITY



4. ALTER (to add a new column, remove/rename existing column, rename table, change datatype):

ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN new_column_name TYPE;
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name;
ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME COLUMN column_name TO new_column_name;
ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME TO new_table;
ALTER TABLE table_name ALTER COLUMN column_name [SET DATA] TYPE new_data_type;


5. DROP statement (to remove a table altogether):

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS table_name;
