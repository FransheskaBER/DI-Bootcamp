ARITHMETIC OPERATION IN POSTGRESQL

- Bitwise operators can be used ONLY with INT

- Operations:


1. Module (%): the answer/output will be what's left over after diving one number by another

syntax: SELECT 15 % 2; (result = 1)



2. Raised To (^): Multiple a number by itself a certain number of times

syntax: SELECT 4 ^ 2; (This means “4 times itself 2 times > 4 × 4 = 16)



3. Square Root (|/): What number, if multiply by itself, give this number?

syntax: SELECT |/16; (result = 4)



4. Factorial (!): Multiply a number by all the smaller numbers down to 1

syntax: SELECT !6; (6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720)



5. Absolute value (@): Drop the minus sign if there is one

syntax: SELECT @-15.07; (result: 15.07)



To do an operation on a table use this syntax:

SELECT field1, field2, field3, field3 math_op
   AS "new_field" FROM table_name

examples:

SELECT id, name, marks, marks -15
   As "marks-15" FROM students;

SELECT id, name, marks, marks *12
   As "marks*12" FROM students;

SELECT id, name, marks, marks /3
   AS "marks/3" FROM Students;
