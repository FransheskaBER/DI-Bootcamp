# AVG()



What does \*\*average of the expression\*\* mean?



1\. \*\*Average in everyday life:\*\*



&nbsp;  \* Imagine you have test scores: 80, 90, 100.

&nbsp;  \* To find the average, you \*\*add them up\*\* (80+90+100 = 270) and then \*\*divide by how many scores\*\* (3).

&nbsp;  \* Result = 270 √∑ 3 = \*\*90\*\*.

&nbsp;  \* So the average is simply ‚Äúthe middle value that represents the group.‚Äù



2\. \*\*Expression in SQL:\*\*



&nbsp;  \* An \*\*expression\*\* is just something that produces a number.

&nbsp;  \* It can be:



&nbsp;    \* A \*\*column\*\* (e.g., `salary`)

&nbsp;    \* A \*\*calculation\*\* (e.g., `price \* quantity`)

&nbsp;    \* Or even a function (e.g., `ABS(balance)`).



3\. \*\*Putting it together (avg(expression)):\*\*



&nbsp;  \* PostgreSQL takes all the numbers produced by that expression for all the rows in your query, adds them up, and divides by the number of rows.

&nbsp;  \* That result is the \*\*average\*\*.



---



\### Example 1: Average of a column



```sql

SELECT AVG(salary) 

FROM employees;

```



\* If the `salary` column has: 2000, 2500, 3000

\* AVG = (2000 + 2500 + 3000) √∑ 3 = \*\*2500\*\*



---



\### Example 2: Average of an expression (calculation)



```sql

SELECT AVG(price \* quantity) 

FROM orders;

```



\* Suppose the orders are:



&nbsp; \* price=10, quantity=2 ‚Üí 20

&nbsp; \* price=5, quantity=4 ‚Üí 20

&nbsp; \* price=8, quantity=1 ‚Üí 8

\* Expression results: 20, 20, 8

\* AVG = (20 + 20 + 8) √∑ 3 = \*\*16\*\*



---



‚úÖ \*\*So in plain words:\*\*

When SQL says \*average of the expression\*, it means:



\* ‚ÄúTake whatever number comes out of this formula/column/expression for each row, collect them all, add them up, then divide by how many rows you had.‚Äù



---



# 

# COUNT()



Perfect, let‚Äôs go step by step with \*\*`COUNT()`\*\* in PostgreSQL.



---



\### 1. What does `COUNT()` mean?



\* In plain English: \*\*It tells you how many rows (records) you have.\*\*

\* Think of it like asking: ‚ÄúHow many things are in this list?‚Äù



---



\### 2. Variations of `COUNT()`



1\. \*\*`COUNT(\*)`\*\* ‚Üí Counts \*all rows\* (doesn‚Äôt matter what‚Äôs inside).



&nbsp;  ```sql

&nbsp;  SELECT COUNT(\*) 

&nbsp;  FROM employees;

&nbsp;  ```



&nbsp;  \* If the table has 50 rows, the result is \*\*50\*\*.



2\. \*\*`COUNT(column\_name)`\*\* ‚Üí Counts only the rows where that column is \*\*NOT NULL\*\*.



&nbsp;  ```sql

&nbsp;  SELECT COUNT(salary) 

&nbsp;  FROM employees;

&nbsp;  ```



&nbsp;  \* If 2 employees don‚Äôt have a salary recorded (`NULL`), and there are 50 rows, the result will be \*\*48\*\*.



3\. \*\*`COUNT(DISTINCT column\_name)`\*\* ‚Üí Counts only unique values (ignores duplicates).



&nbsp;  ```sql

&nbsp;  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT department) 

&nbsp;  FROM employees;

&nbsp;  ```



&nbsp;  \* If there are 50 employees but only 5 different departments, the result is \*\*5\*\*.



---



\### 3. Examples in simple life terms



\* Imagine a list of fruits in a basket:



&nbsp; ```

&nbsp; apple, banana, banana, orange, apple, grape

&nbsp; ```



&nbsp; \* `COUNT(\*)` = 6 (every fruit is counted)

&nbsp; \* `COUNT(fruit)` = 6 (since no fruit is NULL)

&nbsp; \* `COUNT(DISTINCT fruit)` = 4 (apple, banana, orange, grape)



---



‚úÖ \*\*Summary in plain words:\*\*



\* `COUNT(\*)` = How many rows in total.

\* `COUNT(column)` = How many rows actually have a value in that column.

\* `COUNT(DISTINCT column)` = How many different values appear in that column.



---





# MAX()





Great question ‚Äî let‚Äôs break down \*\*`MAX()`\*\* nice and easy.



---



\### 1. What does `MAX()` mean?



\* In plain English: \*\*It finds the biggest value in a column (or expression).\*\*

\* Think of it like asking: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the highest number (or latest date, or largest value) in this list?‚Äù



---



\### 2. How it works



1\. \*\*With numbers:\*\*



&nbsp;  ```sql

&nbsp;  SELECT MAX(salary) 

&nbsp;  FROM employees;

&nbsp;  ```



&nbsp;  \* If the salaries are: 2000, 2500, 3000

&nbsp;  \* `MAX(salary)` = \*\*3000\*\* (the highest salary).



2\. \*\*With dates:\*\*



&nbsp;  ```sql

&nbsp;  SELECT MAX(hire\_date) 

&nbsp;  FROM employees;

&nbsp;  ```



&nbsp;  \* If the dates are: 2020-01-01, 2021-05-10, 2019-03-15

&nbsp;  \* `MAX(hire\_date)` = \*\*2021-05-10\*\* (the most recent date).



3\. \*\*With text (strings):\*\*



&nbsp;  ```sql

&nbsp;  SELECT MAX(last\_name) 

&nbsp;  FROM employees;

&nbsp;  ```



&nbsp;  \* Text is compared alphabetically (dictionary order).

&nbsp;  \* So if last names are: ‚ÄúAdams, Brown, Clark‚Äù

&nbsp;  \* `MAX(last\_name)` = \*\*Clark\*\* (because ‚ÄúC‚Äù comes last alphabetically).



---



\### 3. Everyday analogy



Imagine a race where everyone has a time score:



\* Alice: 12 seconds

\* Bob: 15 seconds

\* Clara: 10 seconds



If you ask for `MAX(time)`, you get \*\*15\*\* (the slowest, because it‚Äôs the biggest number).



If you flipped it and asked for `MIN(time)`, you‚Äôd get \*\*10\*\* (the fastest, because it‚Äôs the smallest number).



---



‚úÖ \*\*Summary:\*\*



\* `MAX()` = the \*\*highest\*\* value in the column (largest number, most recent date, or alphabetically last text).

\* Works on numbers, dates, and text.



---





# MIN()



Perfect follow-up üôå

If `MAX()` finds the biggest value, then \*\*`MIN()`\*\* is its twin that finds the smallest value.



---



\### 1. What does `MIN()` mean?



\* In plain English: \*\*It finds the lowest (or earliest) value in a column or expression.\*\*

\* It‚Äôs like asking: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the smallest number (or first date, or alphabetically first text) in this list?‚Äù



---



\### 2. How it works



1\. \*\*With numbers:\*\*



&nbsp;  ```sql

&nbsp;  SELECT MIN(salary)

&nbsp;  FROM employees;

&nbsp;  ```



&nbsp;  \* If salaries are: 2000, 2500, 3000

&nbsp;  \* `MIN(salary)` = \*\*2000\*\* (the lowest salary).



2\. \*\*With dates:\*\*



&nbsp;  ```sql

&nbsp;  SELECT MIN(hire\_date)

&nbsp;  FROM employees;

&nbsp;  ```



&nbsp;  \* If hire dates are: 2020-01-01, 2021-05-10, 2019-03-15

&nbsp;  \* `MIN(hire\_date)` = \*\*2019-03-15\*\* (the earliest hire).



3\. \*\*With text (strings):\*\*



&nbsp;  ```sql

&nbsp;  SELECT MIN(last\_name)

&nbsp;  FROM employees;

&nbsp;  ```



&nbsp;  \* Last names: ‚ÄúAdams, Brown, Clark‚Äù

&nbsp;  \* `MIN(last\_name)` = \*\*Adams\*\* (because ‚ÄúA‚Äù comes first alphabetically).



---



\### 3. Everyday analogy



Think of exam grades:



\* Alice: 95



\* Bob: 72



\* Clara: 88



\* `MAX(grade)` = 95 (highest score)



\* `MIN(grade)` = 72 (lowest score)



---



‚úÖ \*\*Summary:\*\*



\* `MIN()` = the \*\*smallest\*\* value (lowest number, earliest date, or alphabetically first word).

\* It‚Äôs the opposite of `MAX()`.



---





# STDDEV()



Nice ‚Äî you‚Äôre getting into the more advanced ones now!

Let‚Äôs unpack \*\*`STDDEV(expression)`\*\* very carefully, step by step, without assuming any math background.



---



\### 1. What does `STDDEV` mean?



\* \*\*STDDEV = Standard Deviation.\*\*

\* Plain English: \*\*It measures how ‚Äúspread out‚Äù the numbers are from the average.\*\*



Think of it like this:



\* If everyone in a class scored almost the same grade, the spread is small ‚Üí low standard deviation.

\* If some scored really high and some really low, the spread is big ‚Üí high standard deviation.



---



\### 2. Everyday analogy



Imagine lining up kids by height:



\* If all kids are about the same height, they cluster together (small spread).

\* If some kids are very short and some very tall, the line is very spread out (large spread).



`STDDEV` gives you a number that represents that spread.



---



\### 3. In PostgreSQL



```sql

SELECT STDDEV(salary)

FROM employees;

```



\* If salaries are: \*\*2000, 2100, 2200\*\*



&nbsp; \* They are close to each other, so STDDEV is \*\*small\*\*.



\* If salaries are: \*\*1000, 5000, 9000\*\*



&nbsp; \* They are very far apart, so STDDEV is \*\*big\*\*.



---



\### 4. Why it‚Äôs useful



\* Helps measure \*\*consistency\*\*.



&nbsp; \* Example: In sales, if one seller makes \\$10 every day, and another makes \\$0 one day and \\$100 the next, both might average \\$10/day, but the second person is much less consistent.

&nbsp; \* `STDDEV` tells you that difference in consistency.



---



‚úÖ \*\*Summary in plain words:\*\*



\* `AVG()` = the ‚Äúmiddle‚Äù number (average).

\* `STDDEV()` = ‚Äúhow far away, on average, the numbers are from that middle.‚Äù

\* Small STDDEV = numbers are close together.

\* Big STDDEV = numbers are spread out.



---



# SUM()



Great one üôå Let‚Äôs go through \*\*`SUM(expression)`\*\* slowly and simply.



---



\### 1. What does `SUM()` mean?



\* In plain English: \*\*It adds up all the values from a column or expression.\*\*

\* Think of it like saying: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the total?‚Äù



---



\### 2. How it works



1\. \*\*With numbers (simple column):\*\*



&nbsp;  ```sql

&nbsp;  SELECT SUM(salary)

&nbsp;  FROM employees;

&nbsp;  ```



&nbsp;  \* If salaries are: 2000, 2500, 3000

&nbsp;  \* `SUM(salary)` = 2000 + 2500 + 3000 = \*\*7500\*\*



2\. \*\*With expressions (calculations):\*\*



&nbsp;  ```sql

&nbsp;  SELECT SUM(price \* quantity)

&nbsp;  FROM orders;

&nbsp;  ```



&nbsp;  \* Suppose orders are:



&nbsp;    \* price=10, quantity=2 ‚Üí 20

&nbsp;    \* price=5, quantity=4 ‚Üí 20

&nbsp;    \* price=8, quantity=1 ‚Üí 8

&nbsp;  \* Expression results: 20, 20, 8

&nbsp;  \* `SUM(price \* quantity)` = 20 + 20 + 8 = \*\*48\*\*



---



\### 3. Everyday analogy



Imagine you‚Äôre shopping:



\* Apples: \\$2

\* Bananas: \\$3

\* Grapes: \\$5



When the cashier totals your bill, they‚Äôre doing:

2 + 3 + 5 = \*\*10\*\*



That‚Äôs exactly what `SUM()` does.



---



‚úÖ \*\*Summary in plain words:\*\*



\* `SUM(expression)` = \*\*total of all the values\*\* in that column or calculation.

\* It‚Äôs often used with money, quantities, or anything you want to ‚Äúadd up.‚Äù



---





# VARIANCE()





Excellent question üôå Now you‚Äôre diving into another \*\*statistical function\*\* like `STDDEV`. Let‚Äôs take it step by step in plain English.



---



\### 1. What does `VARIANCE()` mean?



\* \*\*Variance\*\* measures \*\*how spread out the numbers are\*\* ‚Äî just like standard deviation (`STDDEV`), but instead of giving you the spread directly, it gives you the \*\*square of the spread\*\*.



\* Plain English:



&nbsp; \* If numbers are very close together ‚Üí variance is small.

&nbsp; \* If numbers are far apart ‚Üí variance is large.



---



\### 2. Everyday analogy



Imagine you and your friends throw darts at a board üéØ:



\* If all the darts land near the bullseye, the throws are consistent ‚Üí low variance.

\* If darts are scattered all over the board, results are inconsistent ‚Üí high variance.



Variance is the number SQL gives to describe that scatter.



---



\### 3. In PostgreSQL



```sql

SELECT VARIANCE(salary)

FROM employees;

```



\* If salaries are \*\*2000, 2100, 2200\*\*



&nbsp; \* They‚Äôre close ‚Üí variance will be a \*\*small number\*\*.



\* If salaries are \*\*1000, 5000, 9000\*\*



&nbsp; \* They‚Äôre far apart ‚Üí variance will be a \*\*big number\*\*.



---



\### 4. Difference between `VARIANCE()` and `STDDEV()`



\* `VARIANCE()` = spread squared.

\* `STDDEV()` = spread in the same units as the data (like money, height, etc.).



üëâ Example:

If salaries are measured in dollars (\\$),



\* `STDDEV(salary)` = about \*\*‚Äúhow many dollars on average they differ from the mean.‚Äù\*\*

\* `VARIANCE(salary)` = the same thing but squared (so in \*\*dollars¬≤\*\* ‚Äî which is harder to read, but useful in math).



---



‚úÖ \*\*Summary in plain words:\*\*



\* `VARIANCE(expression)` = \*\*a measure of how far the numbers are from the average\*\*.

\* Small variance = consistent values.

\* Big variance = values all over the place.

\* It‚Äôs like `STDDEV`, but squared.



---







# DISTINCT





Great one üôå Let‚Äôs carefully go through \*\*`DISTINCT`\*\*.



---



\### 1. What does `DISTINCT` mean?



\* In plain English: \*\*It removes duplicates and only shows unique values.\*\*

\* Think of it like saying: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt repeat yourself, just give me one of each.‚Äù



---



\### 2. How it works



1\. \*\*On a single column:\*\*



&nbsp;  ```sql

&nbsp;  SELECT DISTINCT city 

&nbsp;  FROM students;

&nbsp;  ```



&nbsp;  \* If the `city` column has:

&nbsp;    `Paris, Paris, Rome, London, Rome`

&nbsp;  \* Result will be:

&nbsp;    `Paris, Rome, London`

&nbsp;  \* (No duplicates).



2\. \*\*On multiple columns:\*\*



&nbsp;  ```sql

&nbsp;  SELECT DISTINCT city, country 

&nbsp;  FROM students;

&nbsp;  ```



&nbsp;  \* Here, DISTINCT looks at the \*\*combination\*\* of both columns.

&nbsp;  \* Example:



&nbsp;    \* (Paris, France)

&nbsp;    \* (Paris, Texas)

&nbsp;    \* These are considered \*\*different\*\*, so both show up.



---



\### 3. Everyday analogy



Imagine you‚Äôre collecting stickers:



\* Your box has: üê∂, üê±, üê±, üê∞, üê∂

\* If you ask for all stickers ‚Üí üê∂ üê± üê± üê∞ üê∂

\* If you ask for `DISTINCT` stickers ‚Üí üê∂ üê± üê∞



---



\### 4. In PostgreSQL results



Without DISTINCT: duplicates stay.

With DISTINCT: only unique values appear.



---



‚úÖ \*\*Summary:\*\*



\* `DISTINCT` = show only unique rows.

\* Useful when you want to remove repeats in your results.

\* Works on one column or combinations of multiple columns.



---







# IN / NOT IN



Awesome üëå Let‚Äôs break down the \*\*`IN`\*\* and \*\*`NOT IN`\*\* operators in PostgreSQL.



---



\### 1. What does `IN` mean?



\* Plain English: \*\*Check if a value is inside a list.\*\*

\* It‚Äôs like asking: ‚ÄúIs this item in the basket?‚Äù



\*\*Syntax:\*\*



```sql

value IN (list\_of\_values)

```



\*\*Example:\*\*



```sql

SELECT name, marks

FROM students

WHERE marks IN (80, 90, 100);

```



\* This will return students whose `marks` are either 80, 90, or 100.

\* Equivalent to writing:



&nbsp; ```sql

&nbsp; WHERE marks = 80 OR marks = 90 OR marks = 100

&nbsp; ```



---



\### 2. What does `NOT IN` mean?



\* Plain English: \*\*Check if a value is NOT inside a list.\*\*

\* Like asking: ‚ÄúIs this item missing from the basket?‚Äù



\*\*Syntax:\*\*



```sql

value NOT IN (list\_of\_values)

```



\*\*Example:\*\*



```sql

SELECT name, marks

FROM students

WHERE marks NOT IN (80, 90, 100);

```



\* This will return students whose `marks` are anything except 80, 90, or 100.



---



\### 3. Everyday analogy



Imagine a teacher wants to call students by ID numbers:



\* The teacher has a paper with IDs: \*\*(2, 5, 7)\*\*.

\* If she asks:



&nbsp; \* `"Is your ID IN (2, 5, 7)?"` ‚Üí Only those students raise their hands.

&nbsp; \* `"Is your ID NOT IN (2, 5, 7)?"` ‚Üí Everyone else raises their hands.



---



‚úÖ \*\*Summary in plain words:\*\*



\* `IN` = ‚Äúis the value inside this list?‚Äù

\* `NOT IN` = ‚Äúis the value not inside this list?‚Äù

\* They are shortcuts for writing lots of `OR` (or `AND`) conditions.



---





# GROUP BY



Perfect üôå You‚Äôre asking about one of the \*\*most important SQL features\*\*: the \*\*`GROUP BY`\*\* clause. Let‚Äôs take it step by step in plain English.



---



\### 1. What does `GROUP BY` mean?



\* Plain English: \*\*It groups rows that have the same value into buckets, so you can calculate something (like COUNT, SUM, AVG) for each bucket.\*\*

\* Think of it like: ‚ÄúPut all the apples in one basket, bananas in another, grapes in another‚Ä¶ then count or total each basket.‚Äù



---



\### 2. Syntax



```sql

SELECT column\_name, aggregate\_function(column\_name)

FROM table\_name

GROUP BY column\_name;

```



---



\### 3. Example



\#### Table: `students`



| id | name  | city   | marks |

| -- | ----- | ------ | ----- |

| 1  | Alice | Paris  | 80    |

| 2  | Bob   | Paris  | 90    |

| 3  | Clara | London | 70    |

| 4  | David | London | 85    |

| 5  | Emma  | Rome   | 75    |



---



\#### Query 1: Count how many students per city



```sql

SELECT city, COUNT(\*) 

FROM students

GROUP BY city;

```



Result:



| city   | count |

| ------ | ----- |

| Paris  | 2     |

| London | 2     |

| Rome   | 1     |



üëâ Explanation: `GROUP BY city` puts all ‚ÄúParis‚Äù students together, ‚ÄúLondon‚Äù students together, etc. Then `COUNT(\*)` tells how many rows are in each group.



---



\#### Query 2: Average marks per city



```sql

SELECT city, AVG(marks) 

FROM students

GROUP BY city;

```



Result:



| city   | avg\\\_marks |

| ------ | ---------- |

| Paris  | 85         |

| London | 77.5       |

| Rome   | 75         |



üëâ Now each ‚Äúbucket‚Äù (city) calculates the \*\*average\*\* marks inside it.



---



\### 4. Important notes



\* You can only `SELECT`:



&nbsp; \* Columns used in `GROUP BY`

&nbsp; \* Aggregate results (like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`)

\* If you try to select something else (like `name` without grouping it), PostgreSQL will throw an error.



---



\### 5. Everyday analogy



Imagine you‚Äôre running a fruit shop:



\* You sell: üçéüçéüçéüçåüçåüçá

\* If you `GROUP BY fruit`, you get baskets:



&nbsp; \* Apples ‚Üí 3

&nbsp; \* Bananas ‚Üí 2

&nbsp; \* Grapes ‚Üí 1

\* Then you can `COUNT(\*)` (how many in each basket) or `SUM(price)` (total money per fruit).



---



‚úÖ \*\*Summary in plain words:\*\*



\* `GROUP BY` = put rows with the same value into groups.

\* Used with aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX).

\* Lets you answer questions like ‚ÄúHow many per category?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the average per group?‚Äù
