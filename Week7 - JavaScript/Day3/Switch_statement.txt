SWITCH statement:
-----------------
- Controls the flow of a program and is part of JS conditional statements.
- Let's you check one value against different options and run different code depending on which option matches the value.

Terminology
--------------------
let > creates a variable and value (it is a block-scoped - only available inside) - for values that wont change
var > same as let but variables and values can be used outside the block scoped
switch > check one variable or one expression
cases > are possible values to compare against
break > stop checking once a match in found
default >  is the else case when not match has been found





syntax:
---------------
switch (expression){
}


Inside the curly braces, there are different cases defined and they are followed by a value that matches the evaluated expression. For example:

switch (expression){

  case value1:
      /* implement the statement(s) to be executed when
      expression = value1 */
      break;
  case value2:
      /* implement the statement(s) to be executed when
      expression = value2 */
      break;
  case value3:
      /* implement the statement(s) to be executed when
      expression = value3 */
      break;
  default:
     /* implement the statement(s) to be executed if expression 
     doesn't match any of the above cases */ 
}


the BREAK statement exists the switch structure after the exercusiton of a case. 


Example:
----------------
Run the program until you find what is the day of the week today:

var day = 2;   //change and try with different values

switch(day)
{
  case 1:      //if day = 1
    console.log("Monday");
    break;
  case 2:      //if day = 2
    console.log("Tuesday");
    break;
  case 3:      //if day = 3
    console.log("Wednesday");
    break;
  case 4:      //if day = 4
    console.log("Thursday");
    break;
  case 5:      //if day = 5
    console.log("Friday");
  case 6:      //if day = 6
    console.log("Saturday");
  case 7:      //if day = 7
    console.log("Sunday");
    break;
  default:    //if day doesn't match any of above
    console.log("Invalid");
}
