suggestions for improvement:
- Consider moving the styles for the details tag in the ErrorBoundary component to a CSS file for better organization and maintainability.
- The comments within the code are helpful, but ensure they remain updated as the code evolves.
- There are some unused import statements that should be removed to improve code clarity.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code only implements the Child component and a DisplayColor component, and some commented-out components. It doesn't include the BuggyCounter, ErrorBoundary, or lifecycle methods as described in Exercise 1, Exercise 2 and Exercise 3. Therefore, the correctness is low.
- The code is relatively readable, but could benefit from more descriptive variable names and comments.
- The use of React.memo is good for performance.
- The code doesn't seem to have any specific security vulnerabilities.
