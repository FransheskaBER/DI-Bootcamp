suggestions for improvement:
- The App component should manage the state of the form inputs and handle the form submission.  It should also include the handleChange function as specified in the instructions.
- The App component needs to pass the state and the handleChange function as props to the Form component.
- The App component should construct the URL upon form submission and redirect the user to that URL.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider extracting the form component into a separate file for better organization, especially as it grows.
