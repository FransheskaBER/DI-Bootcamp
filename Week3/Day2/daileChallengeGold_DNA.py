# Daily challenge GOLD: DNA
# Last Updated: September 13th, 2024

# What You will learn :
# OOP
# Inheritance


# Instructions :
# This challenge is about Biology that will put emphasis on your knowledge of classes, inheritance and polymorphism.

# Build a DNA object. DNA is composed of chromosomes which is itself composed of Genes.
# A Gene is a single value 0 or 1, it can mutate (flip).
# A Chromosome is a series of 10 Genes. It also can mutate, meaning a random number of genes can randomly flip (1/2 chance to flip).
# A DNA is a series of 10 chromosomes, and it can also mutate the same way Chromosomes can mutate.

# Implement these classes as you see fit.

# Create a new class called Organism that accepts a DNA object and an environment parameter that sets the probability for its DNA to mutate.

# Instantiate a number of Organism and let them mutate until one gets to a DNA which is only made of 1s. Then stop and record the number of generations (iterations) it took.
# Write your results in you personal biology research notebook and tell us your conclusion :).
