# API - is the way different applications connect and exchange data with one another

# API - stands for Aplication Programming Interface

# it is a set of protocols that allows exchange in a json format

# we SEND A REQUEST
# and
# we take a RESPONSE

# We need to install a package (a module) by requesting
#import requests
#import json
#import os
#
# response = requests.get("https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random") # the "random" is called END POINT (it can changed and varied depending on what you want to requests)

# Consider this code:

#const lotrQuote = "https://the-one-api.dev/v2/quote/"; #The "lotrQuote" is a variable defined as a string that contains the API route
# $.ajax({ # We use the jQuery and call this query using ".ajax" method > the API is queried and returns either JSON or XML data
#    url: lotrQuote,
#    method: "GET"
#    }).then(function(response){ #that data is pass into the function ".then" and rendered (generated) to the console in its raw form
#        console.log(response);
#    })
